## 🚀 Features

* **Track Applications**: Log each application with important details like:

   * Date applied
   * Company name
   * Role/Position
* **Flexible Status Tracking**: Filter and update applications by their status:

   * Application sent
   * Approved
   * Preparing for interview
   * Custom statuses (user-defined)
* **Notes & Flexibility**: Most fields behave like notes, giving users freedom to personalize field names and content to fit their workflow.
* **Easy Filtering**: Quickly find applications by status, company, or any custom note field.

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Add Application**: Enter the company, role, date applied, and any relevant notes or custom fields.
2. **Update Status**: Change the status as your application moves through the hiring process (e.g., Sent → Approved → Interview Prep).
3. **Filter & Organize**: Use filters to see only the applications you want to focus on—by status, company, or any note.
4. **Custom Fields**: Use flexible note fields to add any information you need (e.g., recruiter name, salary range, next steps).
